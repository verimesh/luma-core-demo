# Luma Core Demo — Ultraslim Reference Implementation

This repository provides the lightweight demo implementation used for validating XIP Protocol concepts:
offline receipts, hub navigation, sync behaviour, and minimal PWA architecture.

## What This Demo Shows

- Offline-first behaviour  
- Hash-chained audit receipts  
- Minimal hub structure  
- PWA installation  
- Local-only event storage  
- Seamless offline → online sync  
- Test flows for Finance, Cannabis, and Government modules  

This demo is intentionally ultraslim — it exists to support early protocol testing, not full UI design.
