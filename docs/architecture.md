# Luma Core — System Architecture Overview

Luma Core is a **sovereign, offline-first, audit-by-default digital infrastructure framework**.
Its architecture enables governments, financial systems, healthcare networks, utilities,
and regulated industries to operate with full integrity — even in low-connectivity or
zero-connectivity environments.

The system is built around three foundational layers:

1. **Audit Receipt Engine**
2. **Cross-Integrity Protocol (XIP)**
3. **Adaptive Communications Layer (ACL)**

Each Luma Hub (Finance, Cannabis, Government, Utilities, Justice, etc.) sits on top
of these layers and automatically inherits their guarantees.

## 🧩 2. Hub Model

Each hub is modular and sovereign:

- Runs independently
- Shares a unified receipt layer
- Uses common policy and verification rules
- Can be enabled/disabled per jurisdiction
- Can be licensed individually or bundled

Examples of hub workflows:

- **Finance Hub** — invoice.create → receipt → settlement  
- **Cannabis Hub** — prescription.issue → dispense → audit  
- **Government Hub** — case.open → update → close  

All workflows produce receipts that flow through XIP and ACL.

## 🔐 3. Audit-by-Default Architecture

Every action triggers:

1. State transition
2. Receipt generation
3. Policy evaluation
4. Hash-linking
5. Optional multi-signature
6. Sync or queue

This means Luma Core provides **real-time integrity**, not after-the-fact logs.

## 🌐 4. Interoperability & Sovereign Deployment

Luma Core supports:

- Single-country deployments  
- Multi-country federations  
- Offline communities  
- Cross-border regulatory exchange  

It is:

- Blockchain-agnostic  
- Infrastructure-agnostic  
- Jurisdiction-aware  
- Permissioned by design  

XIP handles cross-system integrity without forcing a specific ledger.

## 🛰 5. Adaptive Communications Layer

ACL ensures the platform runs under:

- no network  
- unstable network  
- mesh-only  
- satellite relay  
- full internet  

Devices automatically choose the best available path.

This enables:

- emergency operations  
- rural access  
- low-trust environments  
- resilient government systems  

---

## 🏛 6. Deployment Model

A typical deployment includes:

- Mobile devices / tablets (offline-first)
- Local hubs (clinics, councils, pharmacies)
- National Luma Nodes (optional)
- Ledger anchors (optional)
- Mesh nodes + satellite fallback (optional)

All deployments remain **sovereign** — no external cloud dependencies.
