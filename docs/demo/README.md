# 📱 Luma Core Demo — Progressive Web App (PWA)

This directory contains the browser-based demo for **Luma Core**, showcasing:

- Finance Hub  
- Cannabis Hub  
- Government Hub  
- Simulated audit receipts  
- Offline-first behaviour  
- Installable PWA support  

The demo runs *entirely client-side* and contains **no production logic**.  
It exists only to demonstrate how Luma Core hubs operate in a unified interface.

## 🛠 Developer Notes

This demo is a simplified static representation.  
It is **not** the Luma Core engine and contains no cryptography, no XIP implementation, and no real audit chain.

It is safe for public testing, hackathons, funding reviews, and university research.
