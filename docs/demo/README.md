Developer Notes

This browser demo is a lightweight reference build used to demonstrate Luma Core’s offline-first behaviour, hub interface, and receipt workflow in a public environment.

It is intentionally client-side and designed for safe evaluation, testing, and demonstrations.

Full production deployments run on secure device builds with the Luma audit engine, receipt layer, and OPS Command Centre.
