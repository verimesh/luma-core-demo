# 🏛 Government Hub — Documentation Shell

The Government Hub demonstrates how Luma Core supports sovereign digital services
such as identity, cases, public services, utilities, justice, and regulatory workflows.

This file is a documentation shell for future expansion.

---

## 📌 Purpose
The Government Hub provides a unified framework for:

- citizen identity workflows  
- service portals (licensing, benefits, records)  
- case management (PSNI, justice, courts)  
- utilities and metering events  
- global governance data  
- cross-border receipt exchange  
- sovereign audit evidence  

---

## 🔄 Example Workflows

### 1. Case Creation (Justice/PSNI)
`case.open → audit receipt → policy validation`

### 2. Service Request
`service.apply → document check → audit receipt`

### 3. Utilities Event
`meter.event → policy → audit receipt → optional ledger anchor`

---

## 🔐 Receipt Logic

Every workflow is backed by sovereign audit receipts:

- device signature  
- jurisdiction signature (optional)  
- policy rule outcomes  
- previous-hash link  
- timestamp  
- XIP-compatible envelope  

This ensures **tamper-evident, cross-agency auditability**.

## 🧩 Future Expansion

Planned areas include:

- national identity integration  
- council-level dashboards  
- PSNI digital case flows  
- courts & record-keeping  
- social services hub links  
- emergency response coordination
