# Luma Core — Cannabis / Medical Health Hub

The **Cannabis Hub** models a complete medical cannabis workflow for patients,
doctors, pharmacies, regulators, and cross-border verification. It demonstrates
how Luma Core handles regulated, high-compliance industries using audit-by-default
receipts and offline continuity.

This hub is aligned with:
- medical cannabis frameworks (NI/EU/CA/AUS)
- prescription verification workflows
- pharmacy dispense controls
- supply chain integrity rules

- doctor + pharmacy role checks  
- jurisdictional limits

These policies are **recorded inside each receipt** for regulator-grade compliance.
